feature--> develop --> release ----|------> release-2.0 
             ^                      |------> release-3.0  ---> found bugs --------|
             |                                                                    |
             |<------------------------------------------hotfix branch   ---------|         


all feature branches will merge into develop then we cut develop (means create new branch from it called release branch) then we deploy that creatd release branch 

if we found any bugs in release branch then we can rolled backed to previous release branch and to for fixing the bugs of release branches we create hotfix branch

**** scenario to understand relation between develop,release, hotfix.  *****************************
  let say we found bugs release-branch-1.1x then we roll back to previouse release-branch-1.0x
  then we create a hot fix branch from release-branch-1.1x and after fixing all bugs from it we merge it into release-branch-1.1x and will deploy it on dev and demo env after that
  if everything fines then only merge it into develop
